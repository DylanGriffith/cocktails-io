description: This is a very sweet fruity (yet strong) cocktail. I got the recipe from (the Absolut website)[http://www.absolutdrinks.com/en/drinks/vanilia-passion/] but changed it slightly.
ingredients:
  -
    name: Vodka
    amount: 60ml
  -
    name: Amaretto
    amount: 20ml
  -
    name: Apple Juice
    amount: 30ml
  -
    name: Lemon Juice
    amount: 30ml
  -
    name: Sugar Syrup
    amount: 15ml
  -
    name: Passionfruit Pulp
    amount: 3tsp
  -
    name: Vanilla Essence
    amount: 1tsp
method: Fill a shaker with ice then add all the ingredients. Shake thoroughly and strain into a chilled martini glass.
notes: The original recipe had Dry Vermouth but I swapped it for Amaretto which gives it a sweet almondy flavour.
