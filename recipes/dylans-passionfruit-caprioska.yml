method: Get a tall glass you can muddle lime in (not like the ones in this photo, I used a different glass for that). Pour in the sugar syrup and the lime cut into 1/8ths. Then muddle it up. Add 2 teaspoons of passionfruit pulp. Fill the glass with ice. Pour the vodka in. Add another 2 teaspoons of passionfruit pulp. Fill the glass with soda water. Stir thoroughly then garnish with lime.
